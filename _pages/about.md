Hi! My name is Wytamma. I use this blog to help scientists and share ideas. The content of this blog will likely be varied (like my interests). I would like to describe myself as a technical biologist. I'm interested in the nexus of biology and technology (particularly in relation to health research). Being helpful brings me a lot of enjoyment, I especially like helping people on complex technical projects. Please contact me if you think I can be of service (or just to chat ;).
